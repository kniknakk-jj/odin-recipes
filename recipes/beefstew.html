<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Here's a good, solid stew recipe to have in the repertoire - meltin' mustardy beef, made with just 5 ingredients! Anyone else starting to get that autumn feeling? Means it's comfort food season!</p>
<p>If your knife-work is deft, it will take eight minutes to dice and brown the beef, chop the carrots, quarter the onions, and stir in the Worcestershire sauce and mustard. From that point on, you can sit back and let the oven do its thing.</p>
