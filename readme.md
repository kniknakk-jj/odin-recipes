Working through my foundations course with the odin project has brought me to my first project: 
Recipes
I will be using the basic skills I have learned with my linux terminal, git, github, visual studio code and html to create, edit and publicly post one of my favorite food recipes. I will be practicing my commits (as well as proper messaging) to keep track of the work.
